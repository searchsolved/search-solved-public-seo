Takes the Google Analytics Search Terms Report and merges with a Screaming Frog crawl file to find opportunities to Map
internal searches to.

1) Search Terms Report must be Exported as an Excel file
2) Screaming Frog Crawl should only contain category pages (unless you really want to map internal searches to products!
3) Paths are hardcoded, please enter your own for GA, Screaming Frog and the Output.CSV
