Internal Search Report Mapper V2 by Lee Foot 11/01/2021 @LeeFootSEO
Takes the Google Analytics search terms report and merges with a Screaming Frog crawl file to find opportunities to map
internal searches to.

1) Search Terms Report must be exported as an Excel file.
2) Screaming Frog Crawl should ideally contain just category pages, (unless it makes sense for you to map to products).
3) Paths are hardcoded, please enter your own for GA, Screaming Frog and the output csv files
4) V2 Now contains fuzzy matching!
